Identity Management Workshop based on the IPA framework

IPA is an integrated identity management solution providing centralised
user, host and service management, authentication and authorisation in
Linux/UNIX networked environments, with a focus on ease of deployment and
management. It is built on top of well-known Open Source technologies and
standards including 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, Samba and Dogtag
Certificate System.

This hand-on workshop will provide participants with a comprehensive
introduction to Identity Management including server deployment and
administration, client machine enrolment, and configuring server software to
use IPA's centralised identity and policy store. The workshop will also cover
the integration with Microsoft Active Directory by setting up a trust between
IPA and the an Active Directory forest to allow users from AD to access
resources managed by IPA.

Participants will learn about the following topics:

- Install an Identity Management server and replica
- Enrol client machines in the domain
- Create and administer users
- Manage host-based access control (HBAC) policies
- Issue X.509 certificates for network services
- Trust setup with Active Directory

There will be a number of elective units which participants can choose, based
on their progress and particular use cases: 

- Configure a web server to use IPA for user authentication and access control
- OTP two-factor authentication
- Advanced certificate management: profiles, sub-CAs and user certificates
- OpenSSH key management
