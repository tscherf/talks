Securing Automated Decryption

This talk covers an alternative to key escrows using new cryptographic
techniques implemented by the Clevis (client) and Tang (server) projects.

Keeping secrets is tough. It is hard enough when you have control over the full
computing chain. But now we are expected to keep secrets while storing those
secrets in cloud and SaaS infrastructures. At least we can trust the network
providers, right? Of course, the answer is to encrypt the data. But then how do
we know who should have access to the data and when? This talk will look at the
new strategies and cryptographic techniques implemented by the Tang and Clevis
open source projects. Tang forgoes complex (and compromise-prone) key
management infrastructures by using simple algorithms to bind data to third
party entities. Clevis permits sophisticated unlocking policies that go beyond
simply password management to true attributed cryptography. Come see how to
integrate Tang and Clevis into your infrastructure or software project!
